# PnWScrapper
A webscraper designed for the Politics and War webpage-based strategy game


This webscraper was designed to simplify a process of crawling through many (50+) webpages filled of data and automatically export this data to a preformatted Google Sheets document.
Coded in Python using Jupyter notebooks to test.

An example output of the warscraper.py file can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Va5sxro_7mzYHl6Rs-IVHARNv9uiA328LamiyxatcTg/edit?usp=sharing).
